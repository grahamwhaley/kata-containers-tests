# checkmetrics

## Overview

The `checkmetrics` tool is used to check the metrics results files in
either Comma Separated Values
([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values))
or JSON format.
Results files are checked against a
[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
file that contains baseline expectations for the results.

`checkmetrics` checks for a matching results file for each entry in the
TOML file with an appropriate `csv` or `json` file extension.
Failure to find a matching file is classified as a failure for that
individual TOML entry.

`checkmetrics` will continue to process all entries in the TOML file
and print its final results in a summary table to `stdout`.

`checkmetrics` will exit with a failure code if any of the TOML entries
do not complete successfully.

### CSV file format
Each CSV metrics file must contain at least one header line, with the
`Results` in column 5, and at least one line containing a test result
line (that is, the minimum CSV file consists of two lines, one header
and one result value).

### JSON file format

## baseline TOML layout
The Metrics CSV files to be checked, and the range that the median of the
`Results` data is expected to fall within is defined in a TOML file.
This baseline file can be specified by command line or it is installed
in `/etc/checkmetrics/checkmetrics.toml` by default.

Each Metric has a separate `[[metric]]` section within the TOML file.

The following is an example TOML file:

```
[[metric]]
# The name of the metrics test, must match that of the generated CSV file
name = "docker-run-time"
description = "/bin/true cycle time"
# Min and Max values to set a 'range' that the median of the CSV Results data
# must fall within (inclusive)
minval = 0.5
maxval = 1.5

... and repeat for each metric ...
```

## Options
`checkmetrics` takes a number of options. Some are mandatory.

### TOML basefile path (mandatory unless `nobaseline` is used)

```
--basefile value    path to baseline TOML metrics file
```

### Debug mode
```
--debug             enable debug output in the log
```

### Log file path
```
--log value         set the log file path
```

### No baseline
```
--nobaseline        enable parsing metrics without a basefile
```

### Metrics CSV directory path
```
--metricsdir value  directory containing CSV metrics (mandatory)
```

### Help
```
--help, -h          show help
```

### Version
```
--version, -v       print the version
```

## Output
The `checkmetrics` tool outputs a summary table after processing all metrics/CSV
files, and will return a non-zero return code if any of the metrics checks fail.

The following example output was generated from the files detailed in the [Example](#Example)
section.

## Usage

### Download and Build

To download and build `checkmetrics`:

```
$ repo="github.com/clearcontainers/tests/cmd/checkmetrics"
$ go get -d "$repo"
$ (cd "$GOPATH/src/$repo" && go build)
```

## CSV Example

For example, to invoke the `checkmetrics` tool, enter:

```
BASEFILE=`pwd`/../../metrics/baseline/baseline-cor.toml
METRICSDIR=`pwd`/../../metrics/results

$ ./checkmetrics --basefile ${BASEFILE} --metricsdir ${METRICSDIR}
```
This is the example baseline TOML file used to generate the report in the
[Output](#Output) section, and used with the CSV example files below:

```
[[metric]]
name = "testone"
description = "/bin/true cycle time"
# Notionally this test does not have a minimum - smaller is better - but, if we
# get an unexpectedly low number then I think we'd like to know!
minval = 0.5
maxval = 1.5

[[metric]]
name = "testtwo"
description = "/bin/true cycle time min"
# Deliberately fail the min check
minval = 10.0
maxval = 100.0

[[metric]]
name = "testthree"
description = "/bin/true cycle time max"
# Deliberately fail the max check
minval = 0.1
maxval = 0.5

[[metric]]
name = "testfour"
description = "testing for short record file"
maxval = 1.5

```
